# Tower-of-Hanoi
This program simulates the Tower of Hanoi Puzzle with 3 "blocks" (characters A, B, & C) and uses character vectors. The goal of the game is to get the three letters in alphabetical order into the third row. This was one of the first games that I wrote in my free time in C++. It was initially challenging to remember the C++ syntax as I was used to the Python syntax. This was a very rewarding experience once I was able to run the program without errors.
